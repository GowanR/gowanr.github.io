    <span class="firstcharacter">I</span> study Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University and I conduct research as the Mechanical Engineering Student Lead at <a href="https://theluminositylab.com/" target="_blank">The Luminosity Lab</a>.
    My two loves are engineering and math. My focus is at the crossroads of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. I’ve worked on a plethora of projects at The Luminosity Lab over the past three years which I believe perfectly demonstrate my wide range of interests and skills.
